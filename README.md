# cse-6040 Project: Analyzing Personal Running Data


## Context
This analysis was submitted as an extra credit project for the course Computing for Data Analysis as part of the Georgia Tech Master's in Analytics degree.
The assignment was to use skills covered in the class (namely cleaning and manipulating data) to pose and answer questions with a dataset of choice. 

## Summary
I used my running data for the last 4 years to attempt to measure running performance improvement. Using distance, pace, heart rate and other metrics 
measured by my Garmin smartwatch, I explored multiple ways to consider running performance, including speed and effort.
