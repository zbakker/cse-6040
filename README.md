# cse-6040 Extra Credit Project: Analyzing my running data


## Context
This analysis was submitted as an extra credit project for the course Computing for Data Analysis as part of the Georgia Tech Master's in Analytics degree.
The assignment was to use skills covered in the class (namely cleaning and manipulating data) to pose and answer questions with a dataset of choice. 

## Summary
I imported my own running data for the last 4 years to attempt to measure my running performance improvement. Using distance, pace, heart rate and other metrics 
measured by my Garmin smartwatch, I explored multiple ways to consider running performance, including speed and effort.
